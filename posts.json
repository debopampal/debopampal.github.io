    "description": "A signal is just a special type of variable that holds a value. But unlike other variables, a signal also provides notification when the variable value changes. Signals can contain any value, from simple primitives to complex data structures. A signal's value is always read through a getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.",

    "description": "The fundamental characteristics or principles of a reactive system:\nResponsive: A reactive system should provide a rapid and consistent response time, and thus a consistent quality of service.\nResilient: A reactive system should remain responsive in case of random failures through replication and isolation.\nElastic: Such a system should remain responsive under unpredictable workloads through cost-effective scalability.\nMessage-Driven: It should rely on asynchronous message passing between system components.",
