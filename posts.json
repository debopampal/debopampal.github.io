	"description": "A signal is just a special type of variable that holds a value. But unlike other variables, a signal also provides notification when the variable value changes. Signals can contain any value, from simple primitives to complex data structures. A signal's value is always read through a getter function, which allows Angular to track where the signal is used.",
